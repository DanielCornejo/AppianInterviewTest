# AppianInterviewTest
This repository is for the code test for Appian.

In this repository you can find a framework done following Page Object Model which have a page layer, behavior layer and test layer.
Usually I separate page layer and behavior layer from test layer in different projects to optimize pull requests, improvements and code change.

This is only a small piece made in the time I had. It can be improved and optimized

For the porpuse of testing, It is also included a chromedrive in case you want to execute it.
